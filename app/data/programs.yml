  "The community plays a critical role in creating Denver Startup Week’s programming. Each spring, Denver Startup Week puts out a Call for Proposals, in which the community is asked to submit session ideas that they would like to put on during the annual event.
  \n\nSession submissions take all types of shapes and forms: moderated panels, skill-building workshops, keynote presentations, interactive roundtables, competitions, and endless other creative ideas.
  \n\nAfter the Call for Proposals, the public votes on the sessions they would like most to see, and the Organizing Committee ultimately selects the sessions for inclusion in the event program. In 2017, nearly 1,200 sessions were proposed by the community, resulting in 376 individual sessions and events."
